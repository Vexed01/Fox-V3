# This is a fork which maintains the CogGuide cog for my Vex-Cogs repo

As in the original repo, it is on the `cogguide_develop` fork.

Pull will ensure everything there is kept up to date.

The difference is that auto-generated docs will link to a page called getting started instead of telling users to load the cog.
